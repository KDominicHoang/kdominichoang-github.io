TAMS

As an ambitious student at the renowned Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS) at the University of North Texas, I deliberately chose this institution to acquire invaluable research experience and foster personal development through engaging with a diverse array of individuals.

Goals

My primary objective is to employ artificial intelligence as a tool to enlighten those who may be unaware of the vast opportunities available to them. I recognize that numerous individuals face limited personal growth due to their static environments, which can hinder their potential to become well-rounded individuals.

Future

TAMS has granted me the exceptional opportunity to expand my horizons, and I remain steadfast in my pursuit of exploration and continuous learning.
